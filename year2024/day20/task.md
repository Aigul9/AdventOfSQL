## Santa takes on Site Analytics

This Christmas, Santa wants to ensure his elves' marketing efforts reach every corner of the world. By analyzing web traffic, Santa uses a magical query to check how many people visited their site through the "utm_source=advent-of-sql" campaign. He aims to determine which gifts spark the most joy and which regions need extra cheer. It's crucial to match the right toys with eager children!

Parse out all the query parameters from the urls.

A query param is a list of key value pairs that follow this syntax ?item=toy&id=1

Note the & is how to list multiple key value pairs.

Once you extract all the query params filter them so only the urls with utm_source=advent-of-sql are returned.

Submit the url with the most query params (including the utm-source)

If there are multiple rows order by the url ascending
