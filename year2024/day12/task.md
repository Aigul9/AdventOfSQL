## The Great Gift Ranking 🧢

Santa was puzzled. Every year, children's wish lists grew more diverse, making it harder to know which gifts truly captured their hearts. Mrs. Claus suggested tracking not just how many times each gift was requested, but its relative popularity compared to others.

One evening, as elves scurried through the workshop, Santa sat at his ancient desk, reviewing a magical scroll that ranked each gift's standing. The Hat, surprisingly, emerged as this season's most cherished item, while his usually reliable Electronics department saw steady but lesser demand.

This insight would help him adjust his workshop's production and guide his elves' efforts more efficiently. "Sometimes the simplest gifts bring the most joy," he chuckled, watching an elf carefully craft another warm winter hat.

With this new ranking system in place, Santa felt confident he could better understand changing trends and bring more happiness to children worldwide.
