## Conscripting SQL loving elves

Santa paced the North Pole’s icy halls, his jolly facade replaced with grim determination. Amazon had launched same-day drone delivery, threatening Christmas traditions. His elves worked tirelessly, but efficiency was key now—he needed data. “We’re querying the Skills table,” Santa barked. “Who in my workshop knows SQL?”

Eldrin, Faenor, and Luthien stepped forward, their tiny hands clutching keyboards. “We’ll find them, boss,” Eldrin chirped, eyes glinting like snow. They quickly wrote queries to identify coders and logistics wizards, fueling Santa’s battle against tech giants.

By Christmas Eve, Santa’s SQL army prepared. Amazon wouldn't stand a chance. Traditions would prevail.
