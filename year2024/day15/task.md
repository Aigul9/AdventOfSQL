## Santa is missing!

The North Pole was in chaos. Santa hadn't been seen since December 26th when his GPS tracker showed him landing at O'Malley's Bar in Manhattan. Mrs. Claus was beside herself with worry, and the elves were frantically checking their location devices.

"Look!" squeaked Tinker the elf, pointing at the blinking monitor. "His last coordinates are 40.7589° N, 73.9851° W - but what does that mean?"

Your job is to help locate him.
