## Where is Santa's green suit?

Santa's been losing it lately - his workshop office is a maze of crumpled receipts, invoices, and tags from centuries of shopping. "It has to be here!" he bellows, diving into another pile of papers, sending ancient toy receipts flying everywhere. His precious green suit - the one he wanted to surprise everyone with this Christmas - is missing. Mrs. Claus stands in the doorway, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Nicholas, dear, I've told you three times - it's at the dry cleaners. I dropped it off myself." But Santa's too far gone, muttering about filing systems and color-coding as he disappears beneath another avalanche of receipts.

Context:

Santa's personal assistant maintains a digital record of all his dry cleaning receipts. Each receipt is stored as a JSON object in an array, containing details about each garment cleaned, including: receipt ID garment type color cleaning cost drop-off date pickup date
