## Who has the most peers?

"Red alert! Red alert!" Jingle, the Systems Administrator Elf, burst into Santa's office, waving a stack of papers frantically. "We have another organizational problem!"

Santa looked up from his cookie, already dreading what he was about to hear. "What is it this time, Jingle?"

"Well, sir, we've discovered some departments have become extremely... horizontally challenged. We have situations where dozens of elves are all reporting to the same manager!"

Mrs. Claus peered over her candy-cane striped reading glasses. "Ah, the old 'everyone reports to Bob' syndrome. Not good for efficiency, and certainly not good for Bob."

"Exactly!" Jingle exclaimed. "We need to identify the most extreme case - find out which level in our organization has the most elves working side by side. You know, peers reporting to the same manager."

Santa nodded thoughtfully. "This could explain why some of our middle managers look so overwhelmed. Let's write a query to find out which employee has the most peers - other elves at the same level reporting to the same manager."

## The challenge üéÅ

Write a query that finds the number of peers for the employee with the most peers. Peers are defined as employees who share both the same manager and the same level in the hierarchy.

Find the employee with the most peers and lowest level (e.g. smaller number). If there's more than 1 order by staff_id ascending.

Note: When counting peers, include the employee themselves in the count. So two employees who are peers would give a count of 2.

Submit the id of the staff member
