## Santa's Delivery Time Analysis

After reading The Unicorn Project, Santa has become fascinated with applying DevOps principles to his gift delivery system. This December, the North Pole Command Center is activating their advanced GPS tracking system to identify bottlenecks and optimize Santa's Christmas Eve journey across the globe. They've implemented a sophisticated PostgreSQL database with spatial tracking capabilities to measure dwell time and movement patterns, capturing every stop the magical sleigh makes with precise coordinates and timestamps.

The data reveals Santa's current delivery pattern: multiple visits to major metropolitan areas, showing how he systematically covers different neighbourhoods within each city. While this demonstrates good coverage, it may not represent the most efficient delivery flow. By analyzing the time spent in each zone, we can identify where the delivery pipeline might be experiencing constraints.

Each location in the database is carefully mapped using PostGIS geometry, with polygonal boundaries defining the delivery zones of major cities. The timestamps and coordinates will allow us to calculate key metrics such as time spent per zone, frequency of visits, and delivery density patterns. This data-driven approach will help identify where the "magic" of Christmas delivery might benefit from some modern efficiency principles.

Our goal is to analyze where Santa is spending most of his time, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest improvements based on the principles of flow optimization. This report will examine the duration spent in each delivery zone, helping Santa and his team implement continuous improvement in their gift delivery pipeline.

Now we need to find out where he's spending most of his time so he can try to find efficiencies.
