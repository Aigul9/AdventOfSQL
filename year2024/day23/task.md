## 🎄 The Case of the Missing Reindeer ID Tags 🦌

At Santa's Workshop, each reindeer is assigned a sequential ID number for the annual Christmas Eve flight preparation. Mrs. Claus maintains a database table called 'sequence_table' where these ID tags are recorded. One snowy morning, while doing the pre-flight checks, she notices that some ID tags appear to be missing!

The ID sequence should be perfectly consecutive, as the tags were originally created in order (1,2,3...), but after a particularly chaotic practice flight through a snowstorm, some of the tags fell off.

You need to find the missing tags.
