## Summary

By December 10th, the toy workshop was a blur of color and motion. Elves zipped between workbenches balancing boxes of bricks, dollhouse walls, plush animals, tiny race cars, and all the loud, blinking things kids love these days. But high above the workshop floor, three ladders up, past the peppermint rafters, Head Elf Niko paced in a tight worried circle.

Something didn’t feel right.

All month long, the elves had been building toys based on last year’s predictions. But the world moves fast, and toy trends move even faster. What if kids were actually clamoring for LEGO Star Wars ships, Barbie Dreamhouses, Tonieboxes, Bluey sets, Magna-Tiles, and all sorts of modern delights… while the workshop was still churning out far too many fidget spinners, old-school chatter phones, and once-popular gadgets that kids barely remembered?

One wrong guess, Niko feared, and the North Pole would end up with mountains of the wrong toys and not nearly enough of the ones children were hoping for most.

He opened the magical wishlist console, and his heart sank. A massive swirl of wishes streamed past, thousands upon thousands of them. Some children had typed extra spaces. Some wrote in ALL CAPS. Some had letters that danced between cases like playful snowflakes. And there were so many entries that even the workshop’s strongest spreadsheet charms couldn’t hope to hold them.

So Niko did what any sensible elf would do: he called an old friend.

Twenty years ago, a small child visiting the North Pole had excitedly told him, “Someday, I’m going to learn how to work with massive amounts of data!” Niko remembered that child well and now, with the phone pressed to his ear, he could only hope they had kept that promise.

When you answered, breathless from the rush of the season, Niko said:

“I need to know which toys children are asking for the most. I know there's some issues with spelling or the extra spaces or the funny capitalization, but I just need to know what the children truly meant. Can you help me make a cleaned up list of each toy and how many children want it? Please sort it from the most popular to the least. The elves need to know what to build before it’s too late.”

## Challenge

Using the wish_list table, count how many times each cleaned toy name appears, from most requested to least requested. Return the results in two columns: wish and count. Make sure the wish results have no extra leading or trailing spaces and are all lowercase.
