## Summary

Every December, people everywhere eagerly wait for their personalized end-of-year listening recap. The music. The podcasts. The surprises. The guilt about how many times they played that one comfort song on repeat.

This year, a small startup called EchoTrack is launching its very first listening recap feature. Millions of users have logged their listening throughout the year—every song, every podcast episode, every late-night replay.

The product team wants to ship something simple but powerful for version one:

Each user’s most-played artist

How that artist ranks compared to the same artist for other listeners

They assume this will take a massive data pipeline and a week of backend work.

You know better.

With one good query, you can generate the entire recap leaderboard.

## Challenge

Write a query that returns the top 3 artists per user. Order the results by the most played.
