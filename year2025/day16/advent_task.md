## Summary

By the time the Polar Express crossed the frozen lake outside the North Pole, the cocoa situation had turned… complicated.

Every passenger on board had submitted a small preference card earlier that day, listing their favorite cocoa mix-ins: peppermint, marshmallows, cinnamon, shaved chocolate, crispy rice, and more. These preferences were stored as arrays in the passenger system.

Meanwhile, the train’s cocoa was prepared in a handful of specialized Cocoa Service Cars. Each cocoa car stocked its own array of available mix-ins, along with a running total of how many cocoa servings it could still produce.

Then the cold snap hit.

Several cocoa cars lost power and had to shut down immediately. Only the top three most-stocked cocoa cars remained operational. The rest were completely unavailable for serving.

Passengers would stay in their current seats, but stewards would now escort them to one of the remaining top 3 cocoa cars to be served—if and only if that car carried at least one of the passenger’s preferred mix-ins.

The Chief Steward hands you the assignment terminal.

“I need a list of which passengers can safely be served by one of the remaining cocoa cars. The cars must be among the top three by stock, and the passenger must share at least one mix-in preference with that car.”

The train will arrive shortly.

And nobody wants any passenger to be without cocoa.

## Challenge

Get the stewards a list of all the passengers and the cocoa car(s) they can be served from that has at least one of their favorite mixins.

Remember only the top three most-stocked cocoa cars remained operational, so the passengers must be served from one of those cars.
